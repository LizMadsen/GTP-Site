            Gaming Theater Presents is the brainchild of Geek Scorpio started at
            the onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic, when working from home became
            the norm for him, his roommate, and his friends. Geek Scorpio is a
            very social person, and being stuck inside without the ability to
            see people was difficult for him, so he decided to find a reason to
            get a bunch of his friends together over Discord to play video games
            together. It started with Chrono Trigger and several friends giving
            the characters voices, and has evolved from there to include new
            segments, with more planned to come down the road.
