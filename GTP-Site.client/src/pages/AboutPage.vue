              Gaming Theater Presents is the brainchild of Geek Scorpio, started
              at the onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic when working from home became
              the norm for him, his roommate, and his friends. Geek Scorpio is a
              very social person, and being stuck inside without the ability to
              see people was difficult for him, so he decided to find a reason to
              get a bunch of his friends together over Discord to play video games
              together. It started with Chrono Trigger and several friends giving
              the characters voices, resulting in parody videos that end up
              following their own narrative alongside the story of the game, and
              has evolved from there to include new segments, with more planned to
              come down the road.

                and more that are found in games.
